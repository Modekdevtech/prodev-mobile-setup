\# Mobile Development Environment Setup (Expo + React Native)



\## Objective



Mobile development requires more system resources and tooling compared to traditional web development. To ensure a smooth, efficient, and beginner-friendly experience, this setup uses \*\*Expo\*\*, a powerful framework built on top of React Native that simplifies mobile app development and testing.



This repository documents the setup and testing of a mobile development environment using \*\*Expo Go\*\* on a physical device.

\## Prerequisites



Before proceeding, ensure the following tools and requirements are already in place:



\- \*\*Node.js (LTS version)\*\* installed  

\- \*\*Visual Studio Code (VS Code)\*\* installed (recommended IDE)  

\- A compatible operating system:

&nbsp; - macOS

&nbsp; - Linux

&nbsp; - Windows  

\- A \*\*physical mobile device\*\*:

&nbsp; - Android or iOS  

\- \*\*Expo Go\*\* installed on the mobile device  



These tools are essential for upcoming mobile development projects.

\## Why Expo Go?



Unlike web development, mobile apps typically require emulators or simulators for testing. Maintaining and running emulators for multiple device types (e.g., different iPhone and Android models) can be resource-intensive and costly.



\*\*Expo Go\*\* solves this problem by allowing developers to:



\- Run React Native apps directly on a physical device

\- Avoid heavy emulators and complex native configurations

\- Test instantly using QR codes

\- Support both Android and iOS seamlessly



This makes Expo Go a cost-effective, fast, and beginner-friendly solution for mobile development.

\## Installing Expo Go



Follow the steps below to install Expo Go on your physical device:



1\. Visit the official Expo Go page:  

&nbsp;  👉 https://expo.dev/go



2\. Select the \*\*latest Expo SDK version\*\*.



3\. Install Expo Go based on your device:

&nbsp;  - \*\*Android\*\*: Install from the \*\*Google Play Store\*\*

&nbsp;  - \*\*iOS\*\*: Install from the \*\*Apple App Store\*\*



4\. Open the \*\*Expo Go\*\* app after installation.



5\. Create a new Expo account or log in if you already have one.

\## Testing the Setup



Once Expo Go is installed and logged in:



\- Ensure your mobile device and development computer are connected to the \*\*same network\*\*

\- Expo Go will later be used to scan QR codes generated by Expo projects

\- Successful login and app launch confirm the setup is complete

\## Challenges Faced



During the setup process, the following challenges may occur:



\- Network connectivity issues between device and computer

\- Difficulty creating or verifying an Expo account

\- App store download restrictions or slow downloads

\- Older devices running unsupported OS versions



All issues were resolved by ensuring a stable internet connection, updating the device OS where possible, and following Expo’s official documentation.

\## Conclusion



With Expo Go successfully installed and tested, the mobile development environment is now ready. This setup enables fast iteration, real-device testing, and a smoother learning curve for React Native mobile development.



The environment is prepared for upcoming projects and advanced mobile features.

## Scaffolding Steps

1. **Navigated to the Parent Project Directory**  
   Opened the terminal and moved into the main project folder where all mobile development tasks are organized.

2. **Initialized a New Expo Application**  
   Created a new Expo project using the official `create-expo-app` CLI tool.  
   The **Expo Router (Tabs) template** was explicitly selected to enable file-based routing and tab navigation out of the box.

3. **Dependency Installation and Project Setup**  
   During scaffolding, all required dependencies were automatically installed using npm.  
   The process generated a fully configured React Native + Expo environment ready for development.

4. **Project Folder Structure Review**  
   After setup, the generated folder structure was examined to understand how Expo organizes a mobile application:
   - `app/` – Contains all screens and routes managed by Expo Router  
   - `app/(tabs)/` – Defines the tab-based navigation layout  
   - `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` – Home screen rendered when the app loads  
   - `constants/` – Stores shared configuration such as colors and themes  
   - `assets/` – Holds images, fonts, and static resources  

5. **Initial UI Modification**  
   The home screen file (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) was edited to replace the default welcome message with a custom message, confirming that the app renders changes successfully.

## Reset Observations

1. **Project Files Reverted to Default State**  
   Running the reset command restored the application to its original Expo-generated configuration.

2. **Custom UI Changes Removed**  
   All manual modifications made to files (such as changes to the home screen text) were discarded and replaced with default template content.

3. **Application Cache Cleared**  
   Metro bundler cache and temporary files were cleared, forcing a clean rebuild of the project.

4. **Automatic App Reload**  
   After the reset, the development server restarted and the app reloaded with the original Expo template UI.

5. **Clean Development Environment Restored**  
   The reset ensured a fresh starting point, useful for troubleshooting issues or restarting development without residual configuration conflicts.
Observed that all custom modifications made to the application files were removed, including changes to the home screen text.

Noticed that the default Expo Router file structure and example screens were regenerated.

Confirmed that cached build data was cleared, causing the Metro bundler to restart and rebuild the application from scratch.

Verified that after the reset, the application returned to its initial default behavior and UI as generated by the Expo template.
