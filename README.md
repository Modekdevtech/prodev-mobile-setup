# Mobile Development Environment Setup (Expo + React Native)

## Objective

Mobile development requires more system resources and tooling compared to traditional web development. To ensure a smooth, efficient, and beginner-friendly experience, this setup uses **Expo**, a powerful framework built on top of React Native that simplifies mobile app development and testing.

This repository documents the setup and testing of a mobile development environment using **Expo Go** on a physical device.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following tools and requirements are already in place:

- **Node.js (LTS version)** installed  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** installed (recommended IDE)  
- A compatible operating system:
  - macOS
  - Linux
  - Windows  
- A **physical mobile device**:
  - Android or iOS  
- **Expo Go** installed on the mobile device  

These tools are essential for upcoming mobile development projects.

## Why Expo Go?

Unlike web development, mobile apps typically require emulators or simulators for testing. Maintaining and running emulators for multiple device types (e.g., different iPhone and Android models) can be resource-intensive and costly.

**Expo Go** solves this problem by allowing developers to:

- Run React Native apps directly on a physical device
- Avoid heavy emulators and complex native configurations
- Test instantly using QR codes
- Support both Android and iOS seamlessly

This makes Expo Go a cost-effective, fast, and beginner-friendly solution for mobile development.

## Installing Expo Go

Follow the steps below to install Expo Go on your physical device:

1. Visit the official Expo Go page:  
   👉 https://expo.dev/go

2. Select the **latest Expo SDK version**.

3. Install Expo Go based on your device:
   - **Android**: Install from the **Google Play Store**
   - **iOS**: Install from the **Apple App Store**

4. Open the **Expo Go** app after installation.

5. Create a new Expo account or log in if you already have one.

## Testing the Setup

Once Expo Go is installed and logged in:

- Ensure your mobile device and development computer are connected to the **same network**
- Expo Go will later be used to scan QR codes generated by Expo projects
- Successful login and app launch confirm the setup is complete

## Challenges Faced

During the setup process, the following challenges may occur:

- Network connectivity issues between device and computer
- Difficulty creating or verifying an Expo account
- App store download restrictions or slow downloads
- Older devices running unsupported OS versions

All issues were resolved by ensuring a stable internet connection, updating the device OS where possible, and following Expo’s official documentation.
