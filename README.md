# Mobile Development Environment Setup (Expo + React Native)

## Objective

Mobile development requires more system resources and tooling compared to traditional web development. To ensure a smooth, efficient, and beginner-friendly experience, this setup uses **Expo**, a powerful framework built on top of React Native that simplifies mobile app development and testing.

This repository documents the setup and testing of a mobile development environment using **Expo Go** on a physical device.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following tools and requirements are already in place:

- **Node.js (LTS version)** installed  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** installed (recommended IDE)  
- A compatible operating system:
  - macOS
  - Linux
  - Windows  
- A **physical mobile device**:
  - Android or iOS  
- **Expo Go** installed on the mobile device  

These tools are essential for upcoming mobile development projects.

## Why Expo Go?

Unlike web development, mobile apps typically require emulators or simulators for testing. Maintaining and running emulators for multiple device types (e.g., different iPhone and Android models) can be resource-intensive and costly.

**Expo Go** solves this problem by allowing developers to:

- Run React Native apps directly on a physical device
- Avoid heavy emulators and complex native configurations
- Test instantly using QR codes
- Support both Android and iOS seamlessly

This makes Expo Go a cost-effective, fast, and beginner-friendly solution for mobile development.
